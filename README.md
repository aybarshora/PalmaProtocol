## Abstract

**Palma Protocol** is a palm-based, privacy-preserving identity layer built on **Solana** — designed to prove real human presence, authenticate actions, and enable bot-resistant growth.  
Each user’s palm becomes a **cryptographic key**: surface lines for fast mobile onboarding, and subdermal vein scans for high-assurance verification.  

> “Trust should feel human, not bureaucratic.”

##  System Overview

Palm Scan → Feature Extraction → Encrypted Template → On-Chain Proof → Auth / Payment / Reward


- **Two-phase verification:**  
  1. Mobile palmprint capture for quick onboarding.  
  2. In-person palm-vein scan for full verification.  
- **Zero raw image storage:** only non-invertible templates.  
- **Open APIs:** developers can request proof-of-human, liveness, or palm-approved transaction consent.
